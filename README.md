# godot-smoother-node-test-scene
A simple Godot project to test `_physics_process` smoothing interpolation via the [Godot Smoother Node](https://github.com/anatolbogun/godot-smoother-node).

Simply add the `Smoother` node to a scene to interpolate node movements. See the above linked project for more details.

Above: Not smoothed vs. smoothed (player movements are not synced, these are 2 separate runs).
